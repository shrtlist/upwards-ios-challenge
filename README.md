# upwards-ios-challenge

This challenge allows you to choose your own path and lets you flaunt your creative panache and technical skills along the way.

In a fictional world, we are branching into the music business and want to create an in-app experience that allows our users to view trending albums.

## Requirements
- Show the top 100 albums in the US from [this JSON feed](https://rss.applemarketingtools.com/)
- Create a clean, modern look that showcases the album's name, artist, art, and genre
- Implement the app with clean, readable, an maintainable code
- Once completed, email your submission in a .zip file

## Extras
Beyond the functional requirements, feel free to go above and beyond by incorporating the following themes

- Architectures & Design Patterns
- SwiftUI
- Testing
- Bugfixes & Improvements
- Animations
- UI/UX
- Searching
- Other cool features you think of!

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email them to your contact at Upwards. Treat this task as an opportunity to showcase your iOS, engineering, and design strengths. If you want to incorporate a design pattern or multi-module project, go for it! Similarly, if you see a compelling case for more functionality or a more refined design, go ahead and make those improvements.
